# Cryptographic Analysis and Implementation Summer ’23
Self Project
• Analyzed modern cryptography schemes including public-key cryptosystems and symmetric-key algorithms
• Wrote a script to print the plaintext and key using frequency analysis for given Vigenère-encrypted ciphertext
• Generate the SHA-256 digital signature from a file using python and further encrypted it using RSA
